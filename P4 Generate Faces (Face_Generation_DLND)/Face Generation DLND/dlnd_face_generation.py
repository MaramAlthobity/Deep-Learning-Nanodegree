# # Face Generation
# 
# In this project, you'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. Your goal is to get a generator network to generate *new* images of faces that look as realistic as possible!
# 
# The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from **loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks**. At the end of the notebook, you'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
# 
# ### Get the Data
# 
# You'll be using the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train your adversarial networks.
# 
# This dataset is more complex than the number datasets (like MNIST or SVHN) you've been working with, and so, you should prepare to define deeper networks and train them for a longer time to get good results. It is suggested that you utilize a GPU for training.
# 
# ### Pre-processed Data
# 
# Since the project's main focus is on building the GANs, we've done *some* of the pre-processing for you. Each of the CelebA images has been cropped to remove parts of the image that don't include a face, then resized down to 64x64x3 NumPy images. Some sample data is show below.

# 
# This is a zip file that you'll need to extract in the home directory of this notebook for further loading and processing. After extracting the data, you should be left with a directory of data `processed_celeba_small/`

# ## Visualize the CelebA Data
# 
# The [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with annotations. Since you're going to be generating faces, you won't need the annotations, you'll only need the images. Note that these are color images with [3 color channels (RGB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(digital_image)#RGB_Images) each.
# 
# ### Pre-process and Load the Data
# 
# Since the project's main focus is on building the GANs, we've done *some* of the pre-processing for you. Each of the CelebA images has been cropped to remove parts of the image that don't include a face, then resized down to 64x64x3 NumPy images. This *pre-processed* dataset is a smaller subset of the very large CelebA data.
# 
# > There are a few other steps that you'll need to **transform** this data and create a **DataLoader**.
# 
# #### Exercise: Complete the following `get_dataloader` function, such that it satisfies these requirements:
# 
# * Your images should be square, Tensor images of size `image_size x image_size` in the x and y dimension.
# * Your function should return a DataLoader that shuffles and batches these Tensor images.
# 
# #### ImageFolder
# 
# To create a dataset given a directory of images, it's recommended that you use PyTorch's [ImageFolder](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#imagefolder) wrapper, with a root directory `processed_celeba_small/` and data transformation passed in.

# ### Question: What do you notice about your generated samples and how might you improve this model?
# When you answer this question, consider the following factors:
# * The dataset is biased; it is made of "celebrity" faces that are mostly white
# * Model size; larger models have the opportunity to learn more features in a data feature space
# * Optimization strategy; optimizers and number of epochs affect your final result
# 

# **Answer:** Well, I spent about 14 hours on this project. I notice that increasing the number of epochs and batch size produce better results. Having a lot of variety in the image faces will help training model better. Also, it may help to generate new image of faces. Most images  have a low resolution.
